I'm Julio Escobar, 26 years old. I already finish college degree in administration and work in a bank for 2 year, but
few months ago I left the bank and I started to study programming because I want to be a full stack developer.
So I decided to come back to live with my parents and study at home, that's the reason that I don't use car so often. 
Sometimes I use it to take my mom to somewhere because she doesn't drive and sometimes that I go out with friends. 
So basically I could say that I use car one or two times per week, but some weeks I don't use it at all.
